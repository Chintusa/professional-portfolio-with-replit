# **💼 Professional Portfolio with Replit AI**

I've created a **complete portfolio website** using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Below is a detailed breakdown of what I've implemented.

---

## **🚧 Project Structure**

### **🧱 HTML Structure**
- `index.html` contains all the content organized into the following sections:
  - Home
  - About
  - Skills
  - Resume
  - Projects
  - Blog
  - Contact

### **🎨 CSS Styling (`styles.css`)**
Includes responsive and modern design features such as:
- ✅ **Light and dark mode** using CSS variables  
- ✅ **Responsive layout** for mobile, tablet, and desktop  
- ✅ **Smooth transitions** and **animations**  
- ✅ **Modern card designs** with shadows and borders  

### **⚙️ JavaScript Functionality (`script.js`)**
Implements interactive behavior using vanilla JavaScript:
- 🌙 Light/Dark mode toggle with `localStorage` persistence  
- 🔗 Smooth scrolling navigation  
- 📱 Mobile menu toggle  
- 📊 Skill bar animations on scroll  
- 🔍 Project filtering by category  
- 📨 Contact form validation  
- 📌 Scroll-based active link highlighting  
- 🎞️ Scroll-triggered animations

## **🌐 How to View the Website**

You can preview and test the project in one of two ways:
